# World's Hardest Game HD
A project dedicated to recreating the World's Hardest Game in LÃ–VE, meant to make it more customizable and open source.

# Current status
This project is still in very early development and is (hopefully) being updated every day.
Current notes: Full movement has just been finished! The next thing to soon be implemented is level objects (balls and coins).

# Credits
Credit to Stephen Critoph for the creation of the original "The World's Hardest Game", which this remake is based off of. Also, big thanks to Ulydev for creating the push library which this game uses to handle resolutions. Other than that, the only people currently working on development on this project is me, Spookysword.
