# World's Hardest Game HD
A project dedicated to recreating the World's Hardest Game in LÃ–VE, meant to make it more customizable and open source.

# Current status
This project is ARCHIVED, meaning that it is no longer in production and has been rather scrapped or remade to another capacity. Still keeping it, tho.

# Credits
Credit to Stephen Critoph for the creation of the original "The World's Hardest Game", which this remake is based off of. Also, big thanks to Ulydev for creating the push library which this game uses to handle resolutions. Other than that, the only people currently working on development on this project is me, Spookysword.
